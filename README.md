# AI-102-Process-Speech

A code repository for the Process and Translate Speech with Azure Cognitive Speech Services learning path. The content of this repository is related to the modules that form part of the learning paths and content for the Worldwide Learning AI-102 Azure AI Engineer track.

The repo contains folders, and code files where necessary, to support the speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech translation services that are part of the Speech SDK.  The instructions and supporting content for the labs are found on the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) platform and linked to the [AI Engineer role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?roles=ai-engineer).

The content and labs are in various stages of development and release so you may not see all of the content available at the same time this repo is made public.  Therefore, the folders and code files will not appear complete or functional, without the supporting content in place.  Please do not log issues or pull requests unless the supporting content is live on the [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) site.

## Microsoft Learn Labs

The sample code in this repository is for use in hands-on exercises in Microsoft Learn modules.

### Setup

The exercises are designed to be completed in Visual Studio Online. To complete the labs, you'll need the following:

- A Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at <a href ='https://azure.microsoft.com' target='_blank'>https://azure.microsoft.com</a>.
- A Visual Studio Online environment. This provides a hosted instance of Visual Studio Code, in which you'll be able to run the notebooks for the lab exercises. To set up this environment:
    1. Browse to <a href ='https://online.visualstudio.com' target='_blank'>https://online.visualstudio.com</a>
    2. Click **Get Started**.
    3. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
    4. Click **Create environment**. If you don't already have a Visual Studio Online plan, create one. This is used to track resource utilization by your Visual Studio Online environments. Then create an environment with the following settings:
        - **Environment Name**: *A name for your environment - for example, **ai-environment**.*
        - **Git Repository**: https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AI-102-Process-Speech
        - **Instance Type**: Standard (Linux) 4 cores, 8GB RAM
        - **Suspend idle environment after**: 120 minutes
    5. Wait for the environment to be created. This will open a browser-based instance of Visual Studio Code.
    6. Wait for a minute or so while the environment is set up for you. It might look like nothing is happening, but in the background we are installing some extensions that you will use in the labs. You'll see the following things happen:
        - The files in this repo will appear in the pane on the left.
        - After a few minutes (during which there's no apparent activity, but in the background we're setting up the environment for you), a new file named **REFRESH NOW** will appear in the pane on the left. This is your indication that everything has been installed.
    7. After the **REFRESH NOW** file has appeared and the color scheme has changed, refresh the web page to ensure all of the extensions are loaded and you're ready to start.
    8. Note the *.ipynb* files in the **Explorer** pane - these contain the lab exercises.

> **Tip**: you can change the color scheme in Visual Studio Online if you prefer - just click the **&#9881;** icon at the bottom left and select a new **Color Theme**.
